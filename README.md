# MLflow Demo Notebook

This notebook demonstrates how to use MLflow for tracking experiments, managing artifacts, and versioning models.

We'll use the [Wine Quality dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) as a simple example.

**Key highlights**
1. Parameter and metric logging
2. Multiple model runs
3. Model registration and versioning
4. Artifacts and additional assets logging
